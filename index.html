    <h6><u> DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION </u></h6>
    <P>
        Abstract
Driver Drowsiness is the one of the reasons for increase in accident rates. Various facial recognition methods have been proposed to detect and alert the driver in-order to avoid accidents. Hence, this system is proposed to reduce the number of accidents due to drivers fatigue and hence increase the transportation safety. This system deals with automatic driver drowsiness detection based on visual information captured by the system. The driver is lively captured after which the images are further processed, and the fatigue is checked for. It creates an alarm for the driver immediately in case of fatigue detection, also an implementation to alert the vehicles owner and others concerned about the safety are alerted as well. The system enhances the safety measures by which accidents due to drivers drowsiness can be minimized.Driver exhaustion can be a signicant variable in an expensive number of vehicle accidents. RoadAccidents in India cause nancial losses around Rs.9.34 billion every year. It can be seen there are around2,700 road accidents consistently which is one death per every four hours. It has been gured around 25%of car crashes with driver fatalities are due to driver’s drowsiness
